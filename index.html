        <h1><strong>VILLA SARACENO</strong></h1>

<p><img src="https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/431050/raw/master/final-project/images/art_8389_1_villa_saraceno.jpg" alt="villa_saraceno"></p>

<p>Villa Saraceno was build in 1540s by Palladio, commissioned by Saraceno family. Since 1996 is listed in the UNESCO World Heritage Side within other palladian villas of the Veneto. The villa has a rectangular plan and is on two levels resting on a platform. The facade is characterized by a loggia and by a triangular timpano.</p>

<h1>The project</h1>

<p>After the measures analysis, made on the plan and on the facade, it was decided to represent the building in a scale of 1:10 m.

The construction is divided into the following parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>the platform</li>
<li>the two floors</li>
<li>the interior</li>
<li>the loggia</li>
<li>the roof</li>
<li>the facade.</li>
</ul><h2>The platform</h2>

<p><img src="https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/431050/raw/master/final-project/images/podio.jpg" alt="podio"></p>

<p>Platform is made together with the front and back stairs. The cornices and the sides of the platform are created using the primitive SIMPLEX_GRID and they are joined in a STRUCT. The stairs are made iteratively, with a <em>for</em> cycle that generates a stair at a time and returns the STRUCT composed by them.</p>

<h2>The floors</h2>

<p><img src="https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/431050/raw/master/final-project/images/primo_piano.jpg" alt="primo_piano"><img src="https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/431050/raw/master/final-project/images/secondo_piano.jpg" alt="secondo_piano"></p>

<p>The floors are made with the same method, but with different size, using SIMPLEX_GRID to make the side wall and windows. Every side is made separately and then joined to the others in a STRUCT.</p>

<h2>The interior</h2>

<p>The interior walls, the doors and the floor are made using SIMPLEX_GRID and are identically disposed in the first and second level. </p>

<h2>The loggia</h2>

<p><img src="https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/431050/raw/master/final-project/images/particolare.jpg" alt="loggia"></p>

<p>The loggia is composed by three interior columns against the wall, each of them supporting the respective arches, and two columns with an arch on the side wall. The loggia is covered with a barrel vault standing on the side arches. The arches and the barrel vault are made using bezier curves. Specifically are used BEZIER(S0) to generate the single curve, BEZIER(S1) to generate surfaces and the vault, and BEZIER(S2) to make the arches thicker. The columns are made using SIMPLEX_GRID. </p>

<h2>The roof</h2>

<p><img src="https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/431050/raw/master/final-project/images/tetto.jpg" alt="tetto"></p>

<p>The roof is composed by a STRUCT given from the joint of two lateral triangles with two trapezium, all of them realized with SIMPLICIAL_COMPLEX. The roof of the facade is made by two triangles with height equal to that of the main roof.</p>

<h2>The facade</h2>

<p><img src="https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/431050/raw/master/final-project/images/facciata.jpg" alt="facciata"></p>

<p>The facade consists of four columns that support three arches and one triangular timpano. Arches are made like the loggia ones, using BEZIER. The facade upper part and the columns are made with SIMPLEX_GRID and the timpano with SIMPLICIAL_COMPLEX.</p>
